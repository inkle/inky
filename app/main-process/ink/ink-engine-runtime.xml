            The InkList is the underlying type that's used to store an instance of a
            list in ink. It's not used for the *definition* of the list, but for a list
            value that's stored in a variable.
            Somewhat confusingly, it's backed by a C# Dictionary, and has nothing to
            do with a C# List!

            Change the current position of the story to the given path. From here you can 
            call Continue() to evaluate the next line.
            
            The path string is a dot-separated path as used internally by the engine.
            These examples should work:
            
               myKnot
               myKnot.myStitch

            ...because of the way that content is nested within a weave structure.
            
            By default this will reset the callstack beforehand, which means that any
            tunnels, threads or functions you were in at the time of calling will be
            discarded. This is different from the behaviour of ChooseChoiceIndex, which
            will always keep the callstack, since the choices are known to come from the
            correct state, and known their source thread.
            
            You have the option of passing false to the resetCallstack parameter if you
            don't want this behaviour, and will leave any active threads, tunnels or
            function calls in-tact.
            
            This is potentially dangerous! If you're in the middle of a tunnel,
            it'll redirect only the inner-most tunnel, meaning that when you tunnel-return
            using '->->', it'll return to where you were before. This may be what you
            want though. However, if you're in the middle of a function, ChoosePathString

            When saving out JSON state, we can skip saving global values that

            This makes the save file (potentially) much smaller assuming that
            at least a portion of the globals haven't changed. However, it
            can also take marginally longer to save in the case that the 
            majority HAVE changed, since it has to compare all globals.
            It may also be useful to turn this off for testing worst case
            save timing.
